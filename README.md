# Breakthrough-AI-Player
This is an artifically intelligent player to the game Breakthrough, made in Java. The program uses an Alpha-Beta algorithm and a couple simple evaluation functions to decide which move to take next, then makes the move.
Warning, it will probably beat you, because it thinks 6 moves ahead of time!
